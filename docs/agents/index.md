# Autonomous Agents

Axiom includes 30+ autonomous agents that automatically detect and diagnose common iOS and macOS development issues.

## What Are Agents?

Agents are autonomous problem-solvers that:
- **Trigger automatically** based on keywords in your conversation
- **Run independently** with their own model and tools
- **Scan your codebase** for specific anti-patterns
- **Provide actionable fixes** with file:line references and code examples

## How to Use Agents

**Natural language (recommended)** — Just describe what you want:

- "Check my code for accessibility issues" → **accessibility-auditor** triggers
- "Scan for memory leaks" → **memory-auditor** triggers
- "My SwiftUI app has janky scrolling" → **swiftui-performance-analyzer** triggers
- "Review for Swift 6 concurrency violations" → **concurrency-auditor** triggers
- "Check Core Data safety" → **core-data-auditor** triggers
- "Find Liquid Glass adoption opportunities" → **liquid-glass-auditor** triggers
- "Scan for deprecated networking APIs" → **networking-auditor** triggers
- "Review my in-app purchase implementation" → **iap-auditor** triggers
- "Implement in-app purchases" → **iap-implementation** triggers
- "My build is failing" → **build-fixer** triggers
- "My builds are slow" → **build-optimizer** triggers
- "Check my navigation architecture" → **swiftui-nav-auditor** triggers
- "Take a screenshot to verify this fix" → **simulator-tester** triggers
- "Check if my Mac app is ready for notarization" → **sandbox-distribution-auditor** triggers
- "Why does ⌘N create duplicate windows?" → **macos-window-auditor** triggers
- "My NSViewRepresentable doesn't update" → **appkit-bridge-auditor** triggers

**Explicit commands** — For direct invocation:

```bash
/axiom:audit-accessibility
/axiom:audit-memory
/axiom:audit-swiftui-performance
/axiom:audit-concurrency
/axiom:audit-core-data
/axiom:audit-iap
/axiom:audit-liquid-glass
/axiom:audit-networking
/axiom:audit-swiftui-nav
/axiom:audit-icloud
/axiom:audit-storage
/axiom:fix-build
/axiom:optimize-build
/axiom:test-simulator

# macOS-specific agents
/axiom:audit sandbox        # or /axiom:audit distribution
/axiom:audit macos-windows
/axiom:audit appkit-bridge
```

## Agent Categories

### Build & Environment
- **build-fixer** — Automatically diagnoses and fixes Xcode build failures using environment-first diagnostics (zombie processes, Derived Data, simulator state, SPM cache)
- **build-optimizer** — Scans for build performance optimizations (compilation mode, architecture settings, build phase scripts, type checking bottlenecks) with measurable time savings

### Code Quality
- **accessibility-auditor** — Scans for VoiceOver label issues, Dynamic Type violations, color contrast failures, touch target sizes, WCAG compliance problems
- **codable-auditor** — Detects Codable anti-patterns (manual JSON building, try? swallowing errors, JSONSerialization usage) and date handling issues
- **concurrency-auditor** — Detects Swift 6 strict concurrency violations (missing @MainActor, unsafe Task captures, Sendable violations, actor isolation problems)
- **memory-auditor** — Finds 6 common memory leak patterns (timers, observers, closures, delegates, view callbacks, PhotoKit accumulation)
- **textkit-auditor** — Scans for TextKit 1 fallback triggers, deprecated glyph APIs, missing Writing Tools support

### UI & Design
- **liquid-glass-auditor** — Identifies iOS 26+ Liquid Glass adoption opportunities (glass effects, toolbar improvements, search patterns, migration from old blur effects)
- **swiftui-architecture-auditor** — Scans SwiftUI architecture (logic in view bodies, async boundary violations, property wrapper misuse, testability gaps)
- **swiftui-performance-analyzer** — Detects SwiftUI performance anti-patterns (expensive operations in view bodies, missing lazy loading, unnecessary updates, navigation performance issues)
- **swiftui-nav-auditor** — Scans SwiftUI navigation architecture (missing NavigationPath, deep link gaps, state restoration issues, wrong container usage, type safety problems)

### Persistence & Storage
- **core-data-auditor** — Scans for schema migration risks, thread-confinement violations, N+1 query patterns, production data loss risks, performance issues
- **icloud-auditor** — Scans for iCloud integration issues (missing NSFileCoordinator, unsafe CloudKit error handling, missing entitlement checks, SwiftData + CloudKit anti-patterns)
- **storage-auditor** — Detects file storage mistakes (files in wrong locations, missing backup exclusions, missing file protection, storage anti-patterns causing data loss and backup bloat)

### Integration
- **networking-auditor** — Scans for deprecated networking APIs (SCNetworkReachability, CFSocket, NSStream) and anti-patterns (reachability checks, hardcoded IPs, missing error handling)
- **iap-auditor** — Audits existing IAP code for missing transaction.finish() calls, weak receipt validation, missing restore functionality, subscription status tracking issues, and StoreKit testing configuration gaps
- **iap-implementation** — Implements complete StoreKit 2 IAP solution with testing-first workflow (.storekit configuration, centralized StoreManager, transaction handling, subscription management, restore purchases)

### Testing
- **simulator-tester** — Automated simulator testing with visual verification (screenshots, video, location simulation, push notifications, permissions, deep links, log analysis) for closed-loop debugging

### macOS Development
- **sandbox-distribution-auditor** — Audits macOS apps for sandbox entitlements, notarization readiness, code signing issues, Hardened Runtime, and App Store vs Developer ID distribution blockers
- **macos-window-auditor** — Scans SwiftUI macOS window architecture for scene selection mistakes (WindowGroup vs Window), MenuBarExtra state issues, keyboard shortcut conflicts, and openWindow/dismissWindow problems
- **appkit-bridge-auditor** — Detects AppKit/SwiftUI integration issues including NSViewRepresentable lifecycle bugs, Coordinator memory leaks, delegate connection failures, responder chain breaks, and NSWindow access timing problems

## Why Agents?

**Before** (Commands):
- User must remember `/axiom:audit-accessibility`
- Manual invocation every time
- Duplication between command and skill implementations

**After** (Agents):
- Natural language: "check accessibility"
- Automatic triggering based on context
- One source of truth, zero duplication
- Scales better (9 agents = 9 files + 9 commands = 18 total, not 18 duplicated implementations)

## Agent Architecture

All agents:
- Use **haiku model** for fast execution (<1 second scans)
- Provide **file:line references** for easy fixing
- Include **severity ratings** (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Show **before/after code examples**
- Recommend **testing strategies** to verify fixes
